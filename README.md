# Algorithm-Visualization-GUI
A Python PyQt5 single-page user interface which visually displays the process of common search and sort algorithms.
# Details
This project was created and re-factored multiple times with the motivation to increase my knowledge of object-oriented coding, project structure for optimal code reuse, and algorithms.
Using the user interface, the user first clicks to generate a bar chart visualizing a selected amount of random numbers. Next, the user can click to choose whether to “search” or “sort”.  Common algorithms are displayed as choices depending on the users chosen functionality. Once functionality is determined, the user can click to “step” or “finish” the chosen algorithm. The bar chart will change to visually display the changes the algorithm is making.
# What was learned
-	My knowledge and comfort in Python, OOP, and common programming concepts was increased. Generators were a specific programing concept which was heavily looked at and applied. 
-	Project structure was re-factored several times, each time increasing my ability to plan out the flow of logic.
